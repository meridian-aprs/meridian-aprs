## Milestone Detail

### ~~v0.9 — iOS Background Beaconing~~ ✅

Bring iOS to parity with Android's background beaconing capability.

- ✅ Background location permission handling (`_IosBackgroundLocationPrompt` in settings, `IosBackgroundService._requestBackgroundLocationIfNeeded`)
- ✅ Background packet capture while app is backgrounded (`voip` + `bluetooth-central` UIBackgroundModes keep process alive)
- ✅ Position beaconing while backgrounded (`location` UIBackgroundMode + "Always" permission; `BeaconingService` continues on main isolate)
- ✅ Live Activity for persistent status on the Dynamic Island / Lock Screen (`live_activities` package, `MeridianLiveActivity` extension)
- ✅ Auto-reconnect for APRS-IS and BLE TNC transports in background (`ReconnectableMixin` on both connection types)

⚠️ **Apple Developer Portal prerequisite:** App Group `group.com.meridianaprs.meridianAprs` must be created and enabled on both `com.meridianaprs.meridianAprs` and `com.meridianaprs.meridianAprs.MeridianLiveActivity` before Live Activities function.

---

### ~~v0.10 — Map Experience~~ ✅

Make the map functional at real-world scale with adaptive data fetching, time-bounded display, and track history.

- ✅ Viewport-adaptive APRS-IS server-side filter — bounding box (`b/`) derived from visible map bounds with 25% padding and a 50 km minimum floor; replaces fixed 100/150 km radius filters; 500ms debounce on camera idle
- ✅ Configurable time filter for stale station pruning — default 1 hr, hard-cut (stations older than the window are removed from the map and station list); prune runs every 60s and immediately on setting change
- ✅ Track history per station ��� `TimestampedPosition` list per station (capped at 500 entries); position history polylines on the map, bounded by the active time filter window
- ✅ Map filters UI — time window picker and show/hide tracks toggle, accessible from the map screen via a filter FAB (mobile) or toolbar button (tablet/desktop); active filter chip shown on map surface when non-default window is set; Map section in Settings screen with time filter picker

---

### ~~v0.11 — Notifications~~ ✅
Keep operators informed when Meridian is in the background.

- ✅ `NotificationService` — main-isolate dispatch to `flutter_local_notifications` (Android/iOS/macOS) and `local_notifier` (Windows/Linux)
- ✅ Four notification channels registered: `messages`, `alerts`, `nearby`, `system`
- ✅ Android `BigTextStyle` single + `InboxStyle` grouped (3+ conversations) notifications
- ✅ Android inline reply via `RemoteInput` action; terminated-app replies via SharedPreferences outbox
- ✅ iOS inline reply via `UNTextInputAction` / `DarwinNotificationCategory`; foreground delivery via `presentAlert: true`
- ✅ `InAppBannerOverlay` at app root — slide-in banner with callsign/preview/timestamp; full-width mobile, 320 px top-right desktop
- ✅ Banner suppressed when `MessageThreadScreen` for that callsign is active
- ✅ `NotificationPreferences` model — per-channel enabled/sound/vibration, persisted to SharedPreferences, default-on for messages+alerts
- ✅ Notifications settings section — per-channel toggles with sound/vibration sub-toggles (mobile only)
- ✅ Cold-start navigation via `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails()` post-frame
- ✅ Global `navigatorKey` wired to all three `MaterialApp`/`CupertinoApp` variants
- ✅ Nav badge persistence verified (no-op: `unreadCount` was already serialized in `MessageService`)
- ✅ Unit tests: `NotificationPreferences` round-trip, banner dispatch logic, inline reply routing, reply outbox drain
- ✅ ADRs 035–038 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`

---

### v0.12 — Onboarding Improvements
Make the first-launch experience complete and self-sufficient.

- BLE TNC selection in onboarding triggers BLE pairing flow
- APRS-IS selection initiates connection before landing on map
- Map centers on current GPS location (or manual coordinates) on first launch
- Onboarding: add symbol picker, comment field, and location setup steps

---

### v0.13 — Security
Harden credential handling and network filtering.

- Passcode stored in platform secure storage (Keychain / Keystore)
- APRS-IS server-side filter configuration UI

---

### v0.14 — Battery & Performance
Optimize for real-world sustained use.

- Profile and reduce background service battery drain
- Packet processing efficiency review
- Memory usage audit for large station counts
- Evaluate migrating station/packet persistence from SharedPreferences JSON blobs to SQLite (via `drift`): current flat-JSON approach is fine for hundreds of stations but will not scale to large history windows or dense RF environments; SQLite enables indexed bounding-box queries and avoids loading the full dataset into RAM on startup

---

### v0.15 — Bug Triage
Dedicated milestone for clearing the bug backlog before final polish.

- Triage all open `bug` issues
- Fix confirmed bugs prioritized by severity
- Regression test pass across platforms

---

### v1.0 — Launch
The release milestone. No new features — quality, stability, and store readiness only.

- Final UI polish pass across all platforms
- README and public documentation
- App Store (iOS) and Google Play submission
- macOS, Windows, Linux packaging
- Final CI/CD and release pipeline review

---

## Pending Items

- **Tocall:** `APMDNx` allocation filed via `aprsorg/aprs-deviceid`. Placeholder `APZMDN` with `TODO(tocall)` in use until confirmed.
- **macOS/Windows serial TNC testing:** Deferred from v0.4. Still pending physical hardware validation.
- **Stadia Maps tier:** Free tier in use (non-commercial OSS). Upgrade to paid tier when monetization begins.
- **APRS Symbol Icon Set:** Deferred from v0.10. Standalone `meridian-aprs-symbols` repo (CC BY 4.0) — style guide, SVG generation, Figma polish, sprite sheets, integration into Meridian. Schedule TBD.
